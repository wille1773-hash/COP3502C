# Whack-a-Mole (Pygame)

What it is: Grid-based whack-a-mole game. A mole image moves to a new random cell when clicked.

How to run:
1) `pip install pygame`
2) `python whackamole.py`

What I learned:
- Drawing grid layouts and sprites in Pygame.
- Handling mouse events and hit detection with `Rect`.
- Keeping a steady frame rate with the clock loop.
