# Extra Credit: Ticket Pricing

What it is: CLI flow to select a movie/time and calculate total cost for adults/kids with validation on showtimes and party size.

How to run:
1) `python EC1.py`
2) Choose movie (A/B/C), valid showtime, and ticket counts.

What I learned:
- Guarding inputs with early validation and error paths.
- Formatting monetary output.
