# Cow Talk

What it is: Cowsay-style ASCII generator with multiple animal variants (cow, dragon, ice dragon, etc.).

How to run:
1) `python cowsay.py`
2) Follow prompts to choose an animal and message.

What I learned:
- Simple class inheritance to share behavior across variants.
- Text formatting for ASCII art output.
