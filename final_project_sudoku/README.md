# Final Project: Sudoku (Pygame)

What it is: A Sudoku game built with Pygame. Includes board/cell model, puzzle generator, gradient background, and reset/restart controls.

How to run:
1) `pip install pygame`
2) `python sudoku.py`

Controls:
- Click a cell to select it, type 1–9 to fill.
- Buttons: Reset (clear current board), Restart (new puzzle), Exit (quit).

What I learned:
- Building a simple scene graph in Pygame with custom drawing.
- Handling mouse/keyboard events and button hover states.
- Generating valid Sudoku boards and carving puzzles.
