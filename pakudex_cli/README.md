# Pakudex CLI

What it is: Menu-driven creature tracker modeled after a Pokédex. Add species, list them, view stats, evolve, and sort.

How to run:
1) `python pakuri_program.py`
2) Enter menu choices 1–6 to list/show/add/evolve/sort/exit.

What I learned:
- Designing a small data model (`Pakuri`, `Pakudex`) with list-based storage.
- Menu loops with validation and feedback.
- Simple mutation and sorting workflows.
