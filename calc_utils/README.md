# Calculator Utils

What it is: Small calculator module (roots, trig helpers, arithmetic, logarithms, exponentiation) with pytest coverage.

How to run tests:
1) `pip install pytest`
2) `pytest`

What I learned:
- Writing focused, side-effect-free utility functions.
- Handling edge cases (division by zero, invalid log bases).
- Using pytest to validate behavior.
