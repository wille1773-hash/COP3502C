# Blackjack P1

What it is: Intro blackjack simulator using the provided `P1Random` RNG. Tracks player/dealer wins, ties, and win percentage across games.

How to run:
1) `python P1.py`
2) Follow prompts to hit/hold, view stats, or exit.

What I learned:
- Using a custom RNG module and modularizing value/name helpers.
- Simple state machine for menu-driven CLI loops.
- Basic input validation and cumulative statistics.
