# Blackjack Casino (Shoe Variant)

What it is: Expanded blackjack using a 6-deck shoe with shuffle/replenish logic, soft-17 dealer behavior, and per-game statistics.

How to run:
1) `python Casino.py`
2) Choose hit/hold, view statistics, or exit. Dealer stands on soft 17.

What I learned:
- Managing a multi-deck shoe and reshuffle thresholds.
- Implementing blackjack hand valuation with flexible aces.
- Structuring CLI loops with better validation and game flow.
